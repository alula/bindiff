Using BinDiff with Binary Ninja
===============================

This directory used to contain a version of BinExport for the Binary Ninja
disassembler. It now ships as part of Binary Ninja itself.
Like the IDA Pro plugin and the Ghidra extension, it is open source.

Source code and instructions for how to build and use it are available on
GitHub:
  https://github.com/google/binexport/ (Original source)
  https://github.com/Vector35/binexport (Binary Ninja fork)
